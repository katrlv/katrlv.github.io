PassEh was created in a 3-day design challenge in which teams were tasked with creating a plan of action for one of UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).

My team’s UN SDG was Sustainable Cities, and we chose to focus on financial sustainability for new immigrants coming into Canada. Our product was a rewards system called pass’eh which aimed to ease financial stress on people within this demographic. We placed 2nd overall.
