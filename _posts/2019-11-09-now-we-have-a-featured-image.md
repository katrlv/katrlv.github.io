PassEh was created in a 3-day design challenge in which teams were tasked with creating a plan of action for one of UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).

My team’s UN SDG was Sustainable Cities, and we chose to focus on financial sustainability for new immigrants coming into Canada. Our product was a rewards system called PassEh, which aimed to ease financial stress on people within this demographic. We placed 2nd overall.

**MY ANGLE:**

> This project was a pleasure to collaborate on because every member of the design team had first-hand experiences with the lives of immigrants, and so we were all able to come together in a genuine way to build a product that would best suit our users' needs. We each shared stories of our immigrant family members to inspire our design process. I worked on a simple interactive prototype for the project, seen above.
