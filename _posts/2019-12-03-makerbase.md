**SKILLS:** UX Design, User Research, Interactive Prototyping

Makerbase was a project for my design strategy class in which I designed a content source website aimed to provide information on public library makerspaces. My goal was to create a platform that inspires its users to discover and explore the multitude of opportunities made available to them through local public library makerspaces.

**MY ANGLE:**

> As a volunteer at my city's local library, I found myself fascinated with their makerspace and what it had to offer its usersâ€”from private rooms for music-making, to industry-standard software being installed on their computers for patrons to use. I thought it was remarkable that one only needed to drop into the library to learn a new skill that could potentially be the seed for a lifelong passion. This inspired me to work on Makerbase. In this project, I sought to use UX methods to increase engagement with public library makerspaces by improving their accessibility and discoverability through the web. This was my first experience with user testing and conducting user research completely solo. Conducting user research exposed me to the reality of how differently people think, and in turn helped me to understand my own biases and see the things that my own eyes are not able to.
