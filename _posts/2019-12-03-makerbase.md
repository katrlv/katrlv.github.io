**SKILLS:** UX Design, User Research, Interactive Prototyping

Makerbase was a project for my design strategy class in which I designed a content source website aimed to provide information on public library makerspaces. My goal was to create a platform that inspires its users to discover and explore the multitude of opportunities made available to them through local public library makerspaces.

**MY ANGLE:**

> This was my first experience with user testing and conducting user research completely solo. Conducting user research exposed me to the reality of how differently people think, and in turn helped me to understand my own biases and see the things that my own eyes are not able to. I enjoyed digging into peopleâ€™s thought processes and using those insights to improve my designs.
