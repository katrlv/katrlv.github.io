**SKILLS:** Web Design, Wordpress, Graphic Design, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator

In summer 2019, I worked as a Junior Web Designer for Waterloo Catholic District School Board (WCDSB). I was responsible for redesigning their homepage and making changes to the school board website to help with their transition to a new branding style guide. I worked mainly on Wordpress, and made brand-aligned graphics in Adobe Suite.

**MY ANGLE:**

> This was my first experience designing websites in Wordpress, which gave me the opportunity to practice with a lot of custom CSS, as well as to study up on the topic of SEO when improving WCDSBâ€™s websites. I kept in mind a lot of what I had learned about UX and usability when designing for the school board, as I wanted parents and students to be benefitting from every design decision I made. When starting out the design process, I reviewed the designs of different Ontario school boards in order to gain an understanding of what features they tended to take advantage of. I did more research on the usability of these features, and discussed whether or not they should be included in the improvement of WCDSB's website.
